# Marra-Final-Project_1
This is my final for my Social Statistics course, where I analyzed the effects of working mothers on their preschool children and what demographic factors, employment experiences, and workforce stereotypes influenced respondents' answers.  

3.1 Data 

This study uses data from the 2022 General Social Survey (GSS), a nationally representative survey that collects information based on social trends, attitudes/beliefs, and demographics within the United States. The GSS uses a random sample of adults aged 18 and older, providing a robust basis for analyzing beliefs about maternal employment. After cleaning the data and removing cases with missing responses on key variables, the final analytic sample includes 206 respondents. This dataset offers rich context for examining how structural and individual factors influence public opinion about maternal work and childcare outcomes. 

3.2 Variables used

The dependent variable in this study is respondents’ agreement with the statement, “Preschool children are likely to suffer if their mother works.” Respondents either agreed (coded as 1) or disagreed/felt neutral (coded as 0). This variable was not recoded, as it fully captured attitudes toward maternal employment. Approximately 48% of respondents agreed with the statement, while 52% disagreed or remained neutral.

Demographic Factors were measured in two ways, with the first concept variable being educational attainment. Respondents reported their highest level of education, choosing from Less than High School, High School Diploma, Associate’s Degree, Bachelor’s Degree, or Graduate Degree. Recoding was used to group respondents: those with less than a bachelor's degree (Less than High School, High School Diploma, Associate’s Degree) versus those with a bachelor's degree or higher (Bachelor’s Degree, Graduate Degree). Approximately 54% of respondents had less than a bachelor’s degree, while 46% had a bachelor's degree or higher. The second variable measured in this study is family structure, where respondents were categorized as either married or not married (including divorced, separated, widowed, or never married). Approximately 53% of respondents were married, while 47% were not.

The second independent concept, Beliefs about Discrimination, was measured by asking respondents how likely they believed women are to face discrimination in hiring and promotion. Response options included Very Likely, Somewhat Likely, Somewhat Unlikely, and Very Unlikely. Approximately 64% of respondents believed discrimination was likely (Very Likely or Somewhat Likely), while 36% believed it was unlikely (Somewhat Unlikely or Very Unlikely).

Employment Experiences were measured through three variables. The first is the mother’s employment type. Respondents were asked whether their mother was self-employed or worked for someone else. Approximately 14% reported that their mother was self-employed, while 86% reported that their mother worked for someone else. The second is the COVID-19 employment change. Respondents indicated whether they lost a job, gained a job, experienced no change, or were not working before or after the pandemic. Approximately 20% experienced a job loss or gain due to the pandemic, while 80% experienced no change or were not working both before and after. The third is labor force status, where respondents identified if they were employed full-time, part-time, temporarily unemployed, unemployed, retired, enrolled in school, or keeping house. Approximately 62% of respondents were employed full-time, while the rest fell into other categories such as part-time, unemployed, or retired.
